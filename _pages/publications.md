## [Constraining dissensus *and* permissive consensus: Variations in support for core state powers](/files/Accepted paper - WEP.pdf) 
One of the key features of the post-Maastricht Treaty EU is the increasing contestation of its integration. This is often attributed to the EU’s increasing integration of politically salient policy areas core to state functioning, so-called “core state powers” (CSPs). These are often thought to have features making their integration particularly likely to be contested However, whether this equally applies to all core state powers, and whether those with exclusively national identities express generally identical support for all forms of CSP integration, is under-investigated. Using Eurobarometer data from 2019-2021, this article shows that those with no European identity are more likely to oppose CSP integration where it constrains member states’ domestic, rather than external, autonomy. This implies that an emerging constraining dissensus may be less of a challenge for the EU’s increasing foreign policy integration, but that it may hinder further integration of domestic core state power integration.

## [Does differentiation beget differentiation? Examining the link between exposure to and support for differentiation](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5juyg)

Brexit has led to a discussion about what shape the future EU should take. One possibility is to expand the use of what is called differentiated integration, that allows countries to be exempted from new EU laws on either a temporary or permanent basis. However, the question of how past differentiated integration impacts current attitudes towards future differentiated integration is under-investigated. This paper uses recent data examining attitudes towards differentiated integration together with a novel measure of historical exposure to differentiated integration to show that individual variations in both attitudes towards the EU and perceptions of national identity produce diverging responses to the idea that the future EU should become less uniform. In addition to expanding our knowledge of attitude formation to a differentiated EU, the results suggest that the EU's expanding use of temporary or permanent exemptions from EU law may exacerbate the same demands for a less integrated union reflected by a strengthening of Eurosceptic parties in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis.

## [Opting for opt-outs? - National identities and support for a differentiated EU](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79nms/) 
A large literature investigates individual support for European integration. However, support for differentiated integration has only recently become an important topic of study for public opinion scholars. Previous literature on this issue has not probed how differentiated integration is shaped by exclusively national identities, and whether the effect varies by how differentiation has been implemented. Using survey data from 2020-21, I show that exclusively national citizens are most likely to support differentiated integration that allows for greater national autonomy and may oppose differentiation whose primary goal it is to facilitate further integration. I also find that the effect of national identity on such support is largely independent of whether differentiation has been voluntarily chosen by governments or externally imposed by the EU. This raises important questions both about what kind of differentiated integration will enjoy public legitimacy and how regional contexts shape support for EU differentiation.

## [News, Misinformation and Support for the EU: Exploring the Effect of Social Media as Polarising Force or Neutral Mediators](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3889187)
As social media platforms have become a staple news source for many EU citizens, we model repurposed Eurobarometer data from 27 EU member states to explore the possible polarising effects of social media use on public opinion about European integration. In a first step, we investigate whether social media use is correlated with decreased trust in the EU. In a second step, we probe the link between social media news consumption, fake news and polarisation by expanding the cross-sectional analysis with EU level analyses of the interaction between social media use and fake news. Our research paper finds no significant correlation between social media use and increased Euroscepticism at either step. We argue that this lack of significant social media effects at the aggregate level is an argument for why future research on social media effects should incorporate measures of these effects at both the individual and societal level. Thus, while our study focuses on a European context, it holds important lessons for future social media research outside of Europe too.
