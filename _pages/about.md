I am a postdoctoral researcher at Jacques Delors Centre, working in the coordination project of the DFG-funded project [Reconfiguring Europe](https://www.delorscentre.eu/en/research/reconfiguring-europe). The aim of the project is to investigate how the member states of the European Union, in a broad perspective, have historically negotiated the trade-off between contributing resources to the EU institutions with a perceived need to have control over how those resources are spent. 

In addition to working on the determinants of trust in political journalism, my research has two main strands: One strand focuses on the interplay between European integration and national identities, focusing on how integration shapes national identities and vice versa. The other strand of my research focuses on differentiated integration in the EU. I am especially interested in how citizens of non-member states perceive the legitimacy of being subject to EU rules and what shapes public opinion towards different configurations of the EU's institutional set-up. My research has featured in journals such as *West European Politics*, *Journal of European Public Policy* and *JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies*.
