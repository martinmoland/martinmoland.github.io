I am a PhD student at ARENA, Centre for European Studies, based at the University of Oslo. My academic focus is on the study of political behavior, predominantly using survey methodology. I am especially interested in how social identities structure support for EU policies. My PhD project investigates the ambivalence of popular attitudes towards the EU and public opinion towards differentiated integration of the EU.

**Affiliations**

I am associated with the Horizon 2020 projects [EU3D](https://www.eu3d.uio.no/), which offers cutting-edge research on the differentiated nature of EU integration, and [RECLAIM](https://ams.hi.is/en/projects/reclaim/). The latter is a Horizon 2020 funded project investigating both the post-truth turn of political debate, and what demands citizens place on quality journalism today. The project will also investigate EU responses to this post-truth turn. 

I am also affiliated with the project [SINGLEMARKETS](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/research/projects/singlemarkets/index.html). This project investigates popular attitudes to single market governance in the EU and the EU.
