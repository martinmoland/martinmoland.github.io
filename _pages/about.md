I am a postdoctoral fellow at ARENA, Centre for European Studies, based at the University of Oslo. The predominant focus of my postdoctoral research project is on how attitudes towards the truthfulness of political journalism are created. In addition to this I am interested in how social identities form attitudes towards both European integration and transnational cooperation more broadly, as well as in the study of differentiated integration within the EU. 

**Affiliations**

My primary affiliation is with the project [RECLAIM](https://ams.hi.is/en/projects/reclaim/), a Horizon 2020 funded project investigating both the post-truth turn of political debate, and what demands citizens place on quality journalism today. Through this project I contribute to survey experimental research studying how the style of journalism and fact-checking impacts attitudes towards the truthfulness of political journalism.  

I am also affiliated with the project [SINGLEMARKETS](https://www.sv.uio.no/arena/english/research/projects/singlemarkets/index.html). This project investigates popular attitudes to single market governance in the EU and the US. I was previously associated with the Horizon 2020 project [EU3D](https://www.eu3d.uio.no/), which offers cutting-edge research on the differentiated nature of EU integration,
